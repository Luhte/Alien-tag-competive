0.0 How/Where We Moderate + Exceptions


Goals: Our goal is to establish a fair and balanced moderation system that holds wrongdoers accountable with appropriate measures. We want to encourage positive behaviors and constructive social interactions that promote personal growth and discourage negative habits. We believe in second chances, but also recognize that too much leniency can encourage misconduct. Above all, we ask that all participants treat one another with respect, and we promise to carry out our responsibilities with the utmost professionalism.


Where We Moderate: We strive to maintain a judicious approach to moderation, mindful of the importance of privacy and respect for diverse social dynamics. While we are steadfastly opposed to negative behaviors, we recognize that interpersonal interactions in private settings may differ from the norms we uphold. Accordingly, we have established guidelines for our moderating activities. In essence, we will monitor public channels in any server related to Alien tag, including the main server and public servers for semi-pro teams. Exceptions may apply to private channels or servers where all members agree to certain terms, in which case we will not intervene unless evidence indicates a violation of our exceptions. In group chats and private messages, individuals must explicitly consent to rule-breaking, subject to the same exceptions. Finally, while private games with friends are exempt, public lobbies, code ATC, and all scrimmages and matches, regardless of official status, are subject to our moderation policies. [Please report anything that you want even if it's not in our area of moderation but we store all info on people, it could help us discuss and determine future bans.] 


Exceptions: Our exceptions represent the gravest and most reprehensible behaviors that we absolutely refuse to tolerate. These exceptions include the deliberate use of any slur with the intent to harass or intimidate another user, which we consider a form of harassment. We will also not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying, and any exceptions to this rule will be rare. Engaging in or failing to report any form of hacking or other malicious online activities will not be allowed. We take a firm stance against any form of pedophilia or sexual harassment.

Gameplay & Match Rules


Our league has created a unique gaming experience that requires special rules only for our community. We spent a lot of time designing and refining this game mode to make it as fun as possible while still staying true to the original Alien tag game. Our main goal is to get the Another Axiom Development team to add our game mode to the official game, but for now, we need our own set of rules to make sure everyone plays fairly. We also want to create a more relaxed and flexible environment for gameplay, which makes it easier to manage without too many restrictions
A.0 Match Start & prep
[Rules to make sure matches start on time and are efficient] The establishment of fundamental guidelines serves to facilitate the commencement of matches and streamline gameplay for optimal ease and fairness. Specifically, the initial rules governing match procedures aid in the launch of the game and ensure the effective coordination of gameplay mechanics.


* [A] Regulations pertaining to team structure and individual differentiation.
* Matches must be 4v4, you can do 3v3 with permission from staff

* [D] Round setup and match starting prep
* 1 player from each team must get tagged.
* Tagged players must be in the gazebo when the round starts.
* Untagged players must not be on the walls
* The ref will confirm all players are ready.
* When ready the ref will count down from 3 and the match will get off to the start


* [E] During The Round
* The taggers will try to tag all members of the other team (tagging your own team is permitted).
* Once you are tagged you will help your team members try to catch the other team
* Once the entirety of a team is tagged the remaining team will be given a point.
* “round setup and match starting prep” will be repeated. 


*   [F] The Countdown Timer
* During the match there will be a countdown timer that lasts 30 minutes. It will be active at all times, except during breaks.
* Once the timer ends and the current round (if there is one) ends the match is over and whoever has the higher number of points is the winner.
* The round the timer runs out on will continue until the round is over.


* [G] Playable Area
* During the match you may never leave the forest map unless told to by staff.
* The top of any map is not allowed to be played on.
* Any area of a map that is not intended to be reached such as outside the walls of a map is banned.


* [H] Breaks
* Each team gets a signal three minute break to use at any point where teams are not playing. One example of this would be while not during a round.
* During breaks the timer will be paused.


* [I] A Tie
* If the timer ends and the round is over, if the points are tied then the ref will start a best of three (three rounds and the person with 2 points wins).  


* [J] Too Close To Call
* If there is no way to find who won a round (the players were tagged at the same time and there is no recording to slow-mo through) then the round is a tie and no team gets a point.
A.1 Round Reset rules & technical Difficulty
[Rules to help structure the match incase of tech difficulty or round resets] We have established a comprehensive set of regulations to ensure the seamless flow of matches and to prevent any team from being left without players. However, we also maintain a strict stance to prevent any unfavorable position for the opposing team caused by stalling or loss of momentum during the match. Thus, we have put in place stringent rules to address such situations.


* [A] a player leaves without any explanation but is AFK in the lobby, Or claims to not be ready with no explanation of what they are doing. 
* Ref gives a 10 second countdown for players to get back, if they are not back by the end of 10 seconds the other team gets a warning.
* If there teammates can provide why they left and the ref did not hear them then refer to section B


* [B] A player goes AFK with an explanation of what they are doing and asks for time. 
* The player only gets 30 seconds then the round starts.
* If it happens more than 2 rounds for 1 team then stalling rules are referenced to refs discretion. 


* [C] If any runners disconnect mid round, it does not matter what team. 
* The round cannot reset no matter the circumstances, but when player rejoins lobby they are not allowed to help tag the opposing team, so round remains 3v4


* [D] If you want to reset the round to get a tagger of your choice.
* If you start as a tagger but don't want to be tagger, you only get one round in the entire scrim to ask for a starting tagger reset. Per team  
A.2 Stalling rules and punishments
[Rules to help prevent stalling and lack of cooperation] As a league, we firmly disapprove of players who engage in stalling tactics, which we deem to be both juvenile and irresponsible. We have implemented a rigorous policy with minimal tolerance for such behavior, leaving it up to individual players to decide whether they wish to jeopardize their team's success for the sake of frivolous gamesmanship. 


* [A] Intentionally impeding the advancement of the game, such as evading capture or declining to tag the other player. 
* 1st offense = warning
* 2nd offense = player sits out round
* 3rd offense = forfeit of point
* 4th offense = forfeit of match
* 5th offense from same player in a season = stacking 1 month comp bans


* [B] Deliberately engaging in strategic time-wasting maneuvers, such as needing water or switching out controller batteries, or employing similar tactics to disrupt gameplay progression. 
* You get 3 times per team to stop for short periods of time the ref gets to decide how long between 10 seconds to 1 min.
* If you exceed 3 times then you skip to 2nd offense of stalling rule then you move along stalling rule progression


* [C] Engaging in intentional map-hopping as a means of disrupting the momentum of the match, even if only for a brief moment, in order to gain an advantage or create a distraction.
* 1st offense = forfeit of round
* 2nd offense = forfeit of match & 1 month comp ban of player
* Any offenses more than this and stacking 1 month comp bans will ensue.  
A.3 Prohibited tactics 
[Rules about tactics that we as a league do not support and make an effort to prevent] In order to promote fairness in the league, we aim to limit the utilization of tactics to those that are based on fair and skill-based mechanics, thereby reducing the impact of chance. This approach not only ensures a level playing field for all participants, but also enhances the overall entertainment value of matches for spectators.


* [A] Employing hiding strategies. 
* No hiding is hard to define, but refs will be entrusted to identify hiding (Only For 2o Seconds MAX Hiding)
* 1st offense = warning 
* 2nd offense = forfeit round
* 3rd offense =  forfeit match
* 4th offense = stacking 1 month comp bans
A.4 Subbing rules, Matches & Scrims
[Rules about subbing and player replacement] In order to ensure a high level of isolation for banned players during their bans, we have implemented a stringent set of rules that prohibits any participation from such individuals in our league. Furthermore, we strive to maintain a level playing field in all matches, with no substitutions or additional players being allowed to influence the dynamics of play and potentially provide an unfair advantage to any team.


* [A] Using banned players in a “unofficial scrim”
* If scrim is scheduled under name of official team
* 1st offense is 1 very strong warning
* 2nd offense is a instant disbandment and dissolving of the team
* If the scrim is scheduled without official team name but consists of all team players
* 1st offense is a strong warning
* 2nd offense = captain replacement
* 3rd offense = disbandment of team


* [B] Using subs in official matches
* To use a sub in a official match the sub must be on your team, and the sub can only sub in at the start of a new round
* If a team tries to use off team subs during an official match it's an instant forfeit and disbandment. 
A.5 Respecting Ref Rules
[A set of rules put in place to insure cooperation with the ref] One of the primary concerns we have had with previous leagues and communities for Alien tag competitions is the mistreatment of referees. In our league, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of fairness and respect for our referees and their decisions. In the event that a referee makes an incorrect decision, we will handle the situation with video evidence and appropriate measures. However, it is important to note that we have a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of mistreatment towards our referees.It is crucial to understand that referees play a pivotal role in the game, and their decisions can have a significant impact. Therefore, we are dedicated to ensuring that all of our referees are adequately trained and equipped to make the right calls. Additionally, it is important to recognize that our referees are volunteers who generously give their time to enable everyone to participate in the league. Thus, we urge all participants to treat our referees with the utmost respect and appreciation they deserve.


* [A] Being toxic towards the ref and using negative language to address them for example cursing at them or calling them names.
* If it's obviously one player from a team
* 1st offense = warning
* 2nd offense = sit out a round
* 3rd offense = ejection from match + 1 match suspension
* If it’s a team being toxic
* 1st offense = warning
* 2nd offense = 30 second holding of tagger + warning
* 3rd offense = point deduction + final warning 
* 4th offense = match forfeit 
* If it's everyone in the match
* 1st offense = warning to both teams
* 2nd offense = 2nd warning
* 3rd offense =  rescheduling of scrim with different ref


* [B] Arguing with the ref about any decision, the ref's decision is final and issues with decisions will be taken up with the mod team after the match.
* If it's one player arguing a decision
* If arguing 1 decision let them argue for a little bit, but if it gets disrespectful punish based on Toxicity towards ref
* If it's one team arguing a decision 
* Same thing as above
A.6 Contract Rule
[A set of rules put in place to prevent team hopping] As a league, we recognize the potential negative impact of team hopping and a lack of team loyalty. We place great emphasis on the value of loyalty and expect our players to share this sentiment. At the same time, we understand the importance of player activity and engagement within our community. In order to promote fairness and encourage active and loyal participation, we have implemented a stringent set of contract rules for the season. These rules are designed to foster a strong and committed community of players, while ensuring that the competition remains competitive and exciting for all involved.


* [A] When A player Joins a team they have 3 days to decide to stay on that team, In these 3 days that player is not allowed to participate in any official matches for any reason.
* If a player was banned then unbanned but never left team, then rule does not apply
* If the match admin agrees to let a player play in a official match within the 3 days it can be allowed, but there would have to be really special causes for that to happen
* If a player does not wish to stay on the team, they may leave and the 3 day rule resets when they join another team


* [B] When a player joins a team they have a contract for 2 weeks + the 3 intermission days so 17 days in totality.
* If a team initiates contract with someone they may kick that player from the team, however the kicked player is stuck with the contract for 2 weeks
* Teams may not initiate a contract with a player from their opponent's team that week. 
* If a player leaves a team they will still have the contract for the 2 weeks


* [C] When the brackets close and elimination brackets begin, all player transactions will be locked, so you may not join a different team.
* Teams may still kick people during elim bracket, however they cannot replace that player unless the team is deemed in critical condition
* Teams that go into the Elim bracket are allowed to fill their empty spots, however once a spot is filled its filled, if someone leaves you may not fill spot again
* Teams with open positions in elim bracket cannot fill open positions with any of the other previously locked players
A.7 Team Format Rules
[A strict set of rules to make teams organized] We strongly value organization and structure within our teams, and to ensure that our teams are well put together, we have established guidelines and rules regarding team formatting. As a league and organization, we are committed to maintaining a high level of organization and professionalism. One area that we are particularly focused on improving is the quality of team formatting, as we believe that this is crucial to the success and cohesion of our teams.


* [A] Teams can only consist of a maximum of 10 players and a minimum of 4 players
* If a team drops below 4 players they are given until 3 days before next official match to recover a 4th as less than 4 means the team is incapable of play
* If you need more than the default 4 players in team ping the team manager role not mods, admins or other staff


* [B] Teams may not consist of members younger than 13 years of age.
* If a member is found to be under age, we will temp ban them until they turn 13
* We only ban younger then 13 due to the TOS of discord and Alien tag


* [C] Only ONE!! Captain & ONE!! Co-captain can be registered for your team
* We do allow split ownership of a team, but one person must assume captain role and co-captain role. 
* Captain position is not separate from a team player position, so a captain spot will take up a spot on the team, also the captain can participate in comp scrims or matches.
* If you want to participate in scrims and matches as a captain, you wont need to fill a team player role
A.8 Tardiness Rule
[A few rules to prevent bad timing] We have tardiness rules to prevent teams from growing accustomed to showing up late for matches. Our league at a large scale would be having matches stacked on top of eachother, so maximizing efficiency is something we have to do. These rules are strict because they can compromise the other matches happening within close proximity to your own. 


Punishments:


* [A] Both teams have to arrive in code at least 5 min before the scheduled time. 
* If teams are not there 5 min before ref reports it to staff team
* Staff team puts a strike on that team

* If players do not have their names and colors good to go before an early 5 min window up. Punish them for stalling “intentionally impending the advancement of the game”
B.0 ATC codes
[Rules that moderate ATC codes] The establishment of fundamental rules serves to keep the ATC codes successful. All ATC discord rules and punishments  (0.0-1.6) apply in code ATC.
